Hello! My name is Brian Armstrong and I am making the transition to Data Analytics after teaching mathematics in public school for three and a half years. I had graduated from college with a bachelor's in mathematics degree but found that I was always yearning to use my critical thinking skills in other ways.

About a year ago I stumbled upon a coding tutorial for Python after researching ways to keep my mind sharp during the COVID-19 pandemic. I had enjoyed my coding experience in MatLab in a numerical analysis class in college so I decided to give it a shot. After really enjoying diving into Python I decided to see what careers could use critical thinking and some newly developed coding skills. 

I came across data analytics, dove in and haven't looked back since. I've continued to improve my skills in Python, SQL, and most recently Tableau. I hope to continue to improve and make an impact with my developing skills.
